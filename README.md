# Python serverless deploy for gitlab
This is a serverless build image for gitlab python projects.

The image includes python 3.6, node (for servereless plugins),
and vault for reading secrets.

I'm putting this on github because I have nowhere else to put it.
I also don't intend on supporting this, or resisting the urge
to delete it without asking anyone.
